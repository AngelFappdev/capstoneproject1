# capstoneproject1
# My project consists of me trying to sell locally sourced flowers to select states in the United States. This is my first website project and im so excited and proud for it. I have a homepage,login,checkout,user registration and a products page. I also included a footer for my site so that you can subscribe and get deals on an imaginary set of floral arrangments. I really enjoyed doing this project, learning along the way and having my peers help me out.
